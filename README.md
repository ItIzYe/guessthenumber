# Guess the Number

I don't think i have to explain what the Game is about. It's pretty self explaining. The Game has two Modes. `Quick Match` and `Arcade`.




The **Quick Match** contains 10 rounds in which you have to "overguess" your Enemy, a Bot instance which picks it's Numbers randomly. 
**These are the 3 Types, how a round can go**

__Number 1: The Player wins:__

BOT:  The Bot is guessing a number 18 and 39<br>
GAME: Please inser your Number<br>
YOU:  27<br>
GAME: The Bot guessed the Number 23. You<br> 
      outguessed the Bot and gained <br>
      +10pts.<br>

__Number 2: The Bot Wins:__

BOT:  The Bot is guessing a number 18 and 39<br>
GAME: Please inser your Number<br>
YOU:  27<br>
GAME: The Bot guessed the Number 23. He <br>
      outguessed you and gained <br>
      +10pts.<br>
  
__Number 3: Draw:__

BOT:  The Bot is guessing a number 18 and 39<br>
GAME: Please inser your Number<br>
YOU:  27<br>
GAME: Lucky Boy! You both guessed the same
      Number! Nobody gained points.
  
  
specific Rounds can get canceled if you guess a Number outside the spectrum of the Bot.


  
The **Arcade** Mode is an endless Mode. You have three lives and anytime you "underguess" the Bot, you lose a Live. The Bot tells you his Guessing Spektrum before each round. Because there is a much larger Variety of Numbers the Bot can guess, you get +5 points if you both guess the same Number.
**There are 3 possible Ways for a Match to go**

 Once the Match ends, your score gets saved so you can make Highscores. There's also a League System. Based of your score in the Match,you get a random Number of League Points. 
 
 
 
 
 # Menu
 
 there are two Types of Menus. The `Starting Menu` and the `main Menu`. The Starting Menu gives you two options to choose.
 *1. QUICK MATCH*
 *2. ARCADE*
 
 The main Menu gives you the same options, but it also displays your current Highscore and your current League. 
 **So as long as i havent wrote a Login Script, remember to ou the exact same Username each time you Log In**
